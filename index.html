          <div class="intro">
            <p>I enjoy working with a social approach to design. <br><br>As a designer I like to learn new things, both academic and situated exploration driven by curiosity. Design is meaningful to me when it enhances reflexivity by creating space for action and reflection. I have a wide range of experience with material (a bit of a generalist), and especially like visual design and weird crafting of methods and concepts. <br><br>Currently<br>Planning and facilitating for RSD13, autumn 2024.<br><br>Past<br>The Morning Studio, Design Academy Eindhoven, Netherlands, Designer for Levende Gater, PBE, Oslo municipality, Board member, The Oslo School of Architecture and Design, Leader of student council, The Oslo School of Architecture and Design, Seminar leader, Ex.
