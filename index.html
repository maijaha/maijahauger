          <div class="intro">
            <p>I enjoy working with a social approach to design. <br><br>As a designer I like to learn new things, both academic and situated exploration driven by curiosity. Design is meaningful to me when it enhances reflexivity by creating space for action and reflection. I have a wide range of experience with material (a bit of a generalist), and especially like visual design and weird crafting of methods and concepts. <br><br>Currently<br>Master thesis: Imagining (other) Intelligence, spring 2025. <br><br>Past (2022-24)<br>Facilitated RSD13. The Morning Studio, Design Academy Eindhoven, Netherlands. Designer for Levende Gater, PBE, Oslo municipality.
