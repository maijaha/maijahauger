## Getting Started

### Option 1: Simple Local Server (Recommended)

1. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the local development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Option 2: Direct File Access

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. The website will work, but some features may be limited due to browser security restrictions.

### Option 3: Apache Server

If you're using an Apache server, the `.htaccess` file will automatically:
- Set `index.html` as the default landing page
- Enable compression for better performance
- Add security headers

## Navigation

- **Home Page** (`index.html`): Click on the card to navigate to projects
- **Projects Page** (`projects.html`): Click "Home" to return to the main page
- **Project Cycling**: Click anywhere on the projects page to cycle through different projects

## Smooth Transitions

The website features several types of smooth transitions:

1. **Page Load**: Fade-in animation when pages load
2. **Page Navigation**: Fade-out before redirecting to the next page
3. **Project Cycling**: Smooth transitions between different projects
4. **Hover Effects**: Subtle scaling and shadow effects on interactive elements

## Browser Compatibility

- CSS3 transitions and transforms

## Customization

- **Colors**: Modify the CSS variables in the stylesheets
