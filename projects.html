            As a designer I try to be curious. <br><br>
            I enjoy working in collaborative settings, across disciplines. 
            I’m especially interested in public sector design, where I use visual design, facilitation, and method 
            development to create spaces for reflection, learning, and new perspectives. <br><br>

    <p>Explored how Nav’s AI strategy could challenge linear organisational logics. By creating aesthetic disruptions and conversational tools,
         I helped surface tensions and open reflective dialogue. The outcome was a feedbackloop that allows situated learning through experimentation.
         My approach became a method book for an alternative way to deal with change.</p>

        <p>Co-designed with Bærum Child Welfare Services, this project developed a tool to explore tensions in employees core functions and values. By

             broader system-level conversations.</p>

            <p>Together with RICK and Dutch schools, we designed tools for students to shape “spaces of ease,” supporting psychological safety as a
                 prerequisite for creativity. The outcome was a set of adaptable methods that enabled youth to take ownership of their learning environments,
                  building both confidence and creative expression. </p>
